# penguinProject_homework

This repository contains files with the aim to create reproducible code for analysing the data set: Palmer penguins.

The R markdown file initially looks at how data can be communicated ineffectively, by creating a plot and analysing what its downfalls are.
It then goes on to analyse a subset of the data, but this time in a reproducible manner.

When running code in the R markdown file, both the R markdown file itself and the functions packages: cleaning_homework.R and plotting_homework.R will need to be downloaded.
